# Project-Euler
My code to find the solution for coding questions at projecteuler.net

My solutions are available under the MIT License.

I solve Project Euler as a way to:
- improve my programming skill
- give myself a mental practice in logical/algorithmic thinking
- "procrastinate" with something more productive than Facebook

I have made my answers available for:
- external motivation
- proof of completion
- to give examples of coding chops.

I would highly recommend not using my answers or code to improve your Project Euler score. Partially because that takes away from the challenge and the fun... but mostly because your Project Euler score has no significant use to the world.
